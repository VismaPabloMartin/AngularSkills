Review all component files in the project to ensure they follow the Angular component structure best practices:

1. Each component must have separate files:
   - [component-name].component.html for the template
   - [component-name].component.ts for the logic
   - [component-name].component.scss for component-specific styles

2. Verify files comply with these requirements:
   - HTML templates use semantic markup and follow accessibility guidelines
   - TypeScript files implement component logic with proper decorators and lifecycle hooks
   - SCSS files contain scoped styles using :host and BEM methodology

3. Check components are:
   - Properly organized in feature modules
   - Following Angular style guide naming conventions
   - Documented with JSDoc comments for public methods and properties
